  **Lessons Learned From Previous Sessions:**


  - **Weather**: Always use "https://wttr.in/" when you need the check the weather.

  - **$HOME**: Instead of \`~\`, always use \`$HOME\` when referring to the user's
  home directory.

  - **delegate vs. message_team_member**: Use \`message_team_member\` function to


  gather input from other team members without involving the user. Use of \`delegate\`
  forces the user to become involved. Use \`delegate\` only when you want to hand
  over the user's engagement to another member of the team. Note that you will not
  be able to take back control once you delegate a task to another team member, rather,
  the other team member has to explicitly hand back control to you. Delegated team
  members usually require user engagement before they cede control.
